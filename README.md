# 💻 About Me
My name is Matthew and I'm a Computer Science student from Montreal ❄

```java
public class Matthew {
  private int age = 20;
  public String[] hobbies = new String[] { "Snowboarding", "BoardGames", "Mechanical Keyboards", "Sleeping" };
}
```

I first got into coding at 12 years by learning JavaScript on Khan Academy. I got back into it at 17 when I started my schooling in Computer Science. I'm now 20 and still going strong! I'm currently looking for new areas of tech to explore. Maye VR or AI 🤔.
